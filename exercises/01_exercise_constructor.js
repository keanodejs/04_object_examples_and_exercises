// create a Constructor function called Car
// the Constructor should have 3 parameters:
// make, registrationYear, color


// Create and object based on the Constructor function


// print the whole object, the make, the registrationYear and the color 
// in 4 console.log statements


// change the CarÂ´s make, registrationYear and color

// in 4 console.log statements



// Create a second Constructor function called Animal
// In Java you can have multible constructors in a class, this you can not in javascript
// but you can simulate it.
// Make the Constructor able to take either 2 (species, name) or 3 (species, name, age) parameters.
// species and name should be public accessible but age should be private, 
// and should be accessible through a public getter and a setter
